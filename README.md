# Forefront

An opinionated command-line tool for generating front end boilerplate and workflow.

**NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETE**

## Getting Started

TODO: Write this section.

## Why did you make this?

As a Front End developer there are a lot of tools best practices surrounding workflow. My preferred style often forced me to modify or copy paste snippets from different boilerplates and grunt or gulpfiles. I made this command line tool to bootstrap my own client side structure and workflow more easily.

So when I say it is 'opinionated', I basically mean that I made it for myself.

### Why use NPM instead of Grunt or Gulp or whatnot?

One day I was setting up my usual workflow with [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) and I thought to myself: 'This seems to be a lot of dependencies to install simply to repeat what NPM can already do.' As it turns out, [I was not the first person to think this](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/).

## TODO:

* If other Front End developers show interest in this tool, I would make modifications to provide more customization options and modules.
* Provide an option to install third party frameworks (i.e. Bootstrap, jQuery, etc.)
